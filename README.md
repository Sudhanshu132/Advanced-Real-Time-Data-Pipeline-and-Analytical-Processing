## Advanced-Real-Time-Data-Pipeline-and-Analytical-Processing
Designed and implemented a scalable real-time data pipeline that monitors a directory for incoming data, processes it based on specific criteria, and stores the transformed data in a relational database for further analysis. Considered factors such as data integrity, performance, and scalability.

## Technology Stack

- **Apache Spark 3.5**: Real-time streaming and data processing.
- **PySpark**: Python API for Spark for transformation and analytics.
- **Spark Streaming**: Continuous ingestion of real-time data.
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores transformed data for persistence and querying.
- **S3 / MinIO**: Raw data storage and retrieval.
- **Docker**: Containerized Spark environment for consistent deployment.
- **Boto3 / AWS SDK**: Integration with S3 for reading/writing data.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture follows these steps:

1. **Data Source (1)**  
   - Files or sensor data are generated and stored in a local folder or S3-compatible storage.

2. **Data Ingestion (2)**  
   - Spark Streaming monitors the source bucket/folder and ingests data in real-time.

3. **Data Transformation (3)**  
   - Incoming data is cleaned, formatted, and transformed using Spark Streaming and PySpark transformations.

4. **Storing Transformed Data (4)**  
   - Transformed data is written into PostgreSQL for persistence and further querying.

5. **Storing Raw Data (5)**  
   - Tranformed data is optionally stored in a data lake or warehouse (e.g., PostgreSQL, HDFS) for aggregation.

6. **Aggregation & Analytics (6)**  
   - Aggregations, summaries, or feature calculations are performed using PySpark.
   - Aggregated results can be used for dashboards, reporting, or machine learning.
